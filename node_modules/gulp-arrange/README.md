# gulp-arrange

Gulp plugin to make sure the files being streamed are done so in the correct order.
It can be used to make sure depending files coming from gulp.src do not get handled before the file(s) they depend on.
This is especially useful before using gulp-concat to make sure the JavaScript doesn't become invalid because of a wrong order.

## Usage

Put following two snippets in your gulpfile. Near the imports

```js
var gulpArrange = require("gulp-arrange");
```

and in the pipeline you want to influence

```js
.pipe(gulpArrange({

}))
```
